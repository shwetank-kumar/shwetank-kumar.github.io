  <title>Less Magic, More Math: Why Inference Scaling is the New Black</title>
  <dc:creator>Shwetank Kumar</dc:creator>
  <link>https://shwetank-kumar.github.io/posts/inference-scaling/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ah, the sweet smell of progress in the morning! OpenAI has just dropped their shiny new o1-mini and o1 models, and the internet is abuzz with hot takes faster than you can say “AGI winter is coming.” You’ve probably seen the YouTube videos: wide-eyed tech bros marveling at the models’ ability to solve differential equations or explain quantum mechanics to their goldfish.</p>
<p>But let’s be real: you’re not here for another “OMG, AI can [insert mundane task]!” video. No, you, dear reader, are a person of substance. You crave the meaty, first-principles concepts that will help you navigate the choppy waters of AI progress without drowning in a sea of hype. You’re tired of every Tom, Dick, and Elon barging into the AI field like a bull in a china shop, asking everyone to consider their groundbreaking idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherically symmetric cow in n-dimensional Hilbert space.</a></p>
<p>That’s why we’re diving into inference scaling today. It’s a crucial concept that’s driving the impressive performance of these new models, and understanding it is key to grasping the current state of AI technology.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re here to debate whether we’re on the cusp of AGI or if these models are secretly plotting to overthrow humanity and replace us with more efficient toasters, I’m going to have to ask you to see yourself out. There are plenty of Twitter threads and subreddits where you can indulge in that particular flavor of speculation. We’re here for the nitty-gritty, the nuts and bolts, the “how does this actually work?” of it all.</p>
<p>So, strap in, silence your phone (unless you’re reading this on it, in which case, carry on), and let’s embark on a journey into the heart of inference scaling. It’s time to learn why OpenAI is betting big on this approach, and why you should care. Welcome to the bleeding edge of AI, where the cows are spherical, the Hilbert spaces are infinite, and the potential for groundbreaking insights is limitless.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Before we dive in, I just want to be super clear: what follows is my best understanding of inference scaling based on publicly available information. As for what’s really going on inside OpenAI’s secret volcano lair? Well, your guess is as good as mine. They’re about as forthcoming with their methods as a cat is with its tax returns.</p>

<section id="the-assembly-line-of-sentences-how-language-models-work-infer" class="level1">
<h1>The Assembly Line of Sentences: How Language Models Work (Infer)</h1>
<p>Now that we’ve cleared the air of AGI speculation and spherical bovines, let’s delve into the intricacies underpinning inference scaling. Note that this is not only about throwing more FLOPs at the problem. To understand how inference scaling works we need to first understand how basic inference works.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that you’re running a factory. Not just any factory, mind you, but one that produces bespoke, artisanal sentences on demand. Your raw materials? Vectors of floating-point numbers. Your end product? Everything from Shakespearean sonnets to Python code.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Large Language Model inferencing. It’s a bit like running a just-in-time manufacturing operation, except instead of assembling cars, you’re assembling words. And let me tell you, the logistics are <em>fascinating</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s break down this process, shall we? It all starts with a prompt. Think of this as the order form for your sentence factory. “I need a limerick about database optimization, stat!” your customer (who is suspiciously often yourself) demands. Your factory springs into action:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Tokenizer</strong>: This is your receiving department. It breaks down the incoming order into bite-sized pieces the rest of the factory can work with. “Database” might become “data” and “base”, while “optimization” could be “optim” and “ization”. It’s like those old “FRAGILE: HANDLE WITH CARE” stamps, except here it’s “LANGUAGE: HANDLE WITH VECTORS”. The tokenizer layer is the gatekeeper of language models, transforming raw text into a format the model can understand. Think of it as a translator that converts human-readable text into a sequence of numbers (tokens) that the AI can process.</p>
<pre><code>                          Tokenize(text) = [token_1, token_2, ..., token_n]</code></pre>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?token_i%20=%20vocabulary_%7Bindex%7D(subword_i)">. Algorithmically, the process works in 3 sub-steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Segmentation:</strong> The input text is broken down into subwords, words, or characters, depending on the tokenization strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Lookup:</strong> Each subword is mapped to a unique integer index in the model’s vocabulary.</li>
<li><strong>Token Generation:</strong> The sequence of these indices forms the final token sequence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Embedding Layer</strong>: This is where the magic of turning words into numbers happens. It’s as if each word is run through a very complex, very mathy Instagram filter. “Data” doesn’t just mean “data” anymore; it’s now a list of 768 floating-point numbers that somehow capture the essence of “data-ness”. Imagine the embedding layer as a massive, multidimensional dictionary or lookup table. Here’s is its structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rows:</strong> Each row in this table corresponds to a token in your vocabulary. If your model has a vocabulary of 50,000 words, your table has 50,000 rows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Columns:</strong> Each column represents a dimension of the embedding. If you’re using 300-dimensional embeddings, your table has 300 columns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cells:</strong> Each cell in this table contains a single number, typically a floating-point value.</p>
<pre><code>                           Embedding(token_id) = LookupTable[token_id]</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>where LookupTable is a matrix of shape (vocab_size, embedding_dim)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Transformer Layers</strong>: These layers have been covered very well in multiple posts all over the net, specifically look at [3] for more detail. This is the real engine of your factory. Imagine a room full of savants, each one looking at your partial sentence, conferring with other savants based on information they have, and then scribbling notes about what word should come next. Now imagine doing this dozens of times in parallel while sharing information. That’s what’s happening here, except the savants are matrix multiplications and the notes are more vectors. There are other parts to the layer but at the heart of of this communcation and compute is the attention layer which can be specified by Key, Value, Query triplets (K,Q,V) as follows: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Attention(Q,%20K,%20V)%20=%20softmax((QK%5ET)%20/%20%E2%88%9Ad_k)%20V%0A"></p>
<p>where, Key represents information that each of them has, Query is each one asking - hey who has this information that I need and Value is the information that they share with each other once they identify the overlap between whats needed and what they have based on the dot product between K and Q.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Output Layer</strong>: This is your quality control department. It takes all those scribbled savant notes and turns them into actual probabilities for each word in your vocabulary. “The” might get a 2% chance, “database” a 0.5% chance, and “aardvark” a 0.0001% chance. (Hey, you never know when you might need an aardvark in your limerick about databases).</p>
<p>This is embodied by our Softmax layer. It takes the raw scores (often called logits) associated with each possible token in the vocabulary and transforms them into a probability distribution. Essentially, for each position in a sequence, the softmax layer calculates the likelihood of each token in the vocabulary appearing in that position. It does this by exponentiating the scores and then normalizing them so that they sum to 1. This process ensures that the model outputs a valid probability distribution over all possible tokens, allowing it to make predictions about the most likely next token in a sequence or to classify tokens into different categories. Mathematically, you can write it as: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Asoftmax(x_i)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cexp(x_i)%7D%7B%5Csum_j%20%5Cexp(x_j)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>where i is the current token and j iterates over all tokens in the vocabulary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Token Selection and Iteration</strong>: This is where your factory’s assembly line completes its cycle by choosing the next token based on Softmax output, transforming probability distributions into the next token in the sequence. This step is also where you decide how wild you want your factory’s output to be. e.g.&nbsp;Greedy search tends to produce more repetitive text, while sampling methods can lead to more varied and sometimes surprising results*.</p>
<p>Finally, we get a sequence of tokens that we convert into readable text using the inverse transform from look up tables in Step 1. i.e.&nbsp;if you were inputting rows and reading off columns as the output, here you input columns and read off rows and vice-versa.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By repeating this process, your AI factory can churn out everything from simple sentences to complex essays - Or entire essay about why PostgreSQL is actually a misunderstood performance art piece. (Don’t judge. GPT-4o has some weird hobbies.) How you generate tokens, iterate, and post process in this last step is what defines how “thoughtful” your LLM sounds. Lets dig into that in the next section.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fundamentals-of-token-selection-navigating-vast-probability-spaces">The Fundamentals of Token Selection: Navigating Vast Probability Spaces</h2>
<p>At its core, inference in a Large Language Model (LLM) is about predicting the next token in a sequence, given the previous tokens. It’s like playing a cosmic game of “what comes next?” where the stakes are coherent communication. LLMs accomplish this feat by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and storing a compressed version of it in their parameters. However, this nominally simple task hides a universe of complexity that would make even the most seasoned computer scientists break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<section id="the-vastness-of-possibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-vastness-of-possibility">The Vastness of Possibility</h3>
<p>Imagine you’re an LLM with a vocabulary of |V| tokens, trying to generate a sequence of length T. The naive search space for this task is O(|V|^T). To put this into perspective, if you have a modest vocabulary of 50,000 tokens (which is on the small side for modern LLMs) and you’re generating a sequence of just 20 tokens, you’re looking at 50,000^20 possibilities.</p>
<p>That’s a number so large it makes the number of atoms in the observable universe look like pocket change. If each possibility were a grain of sand, you’d have enough to build a beach that stretches from here to Alpha Centauri, with enough left over to fill the Mariana Trench. Twice.</p>
<p>Clearly, brute-forcing our way through this cosmic beach of possibilities isn’t feasible, even with the most powerful supercomputers at our disposal. We need a smarter approach.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enter-the-decoding-strategies">Enter the Decoding Strategies</h3>
<p>So given these insurmountable odds, how do LLMs figure out what token to generate next? Enter the world of decoding strategies! Depending on the strategies used and the choice of parameters used to tune them you might get text that is coherent, engaging, surprising or a combination there of. Just remember it will always be sampled from the underlying probability distribution that was learned during the training phase.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these strategies which we will need to understand inference scaling. There are many more which are well covered in [2] and similar articles.</p>
<section id="beam-search-the-chess-grandmaster" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beam-search-the-chess-grandmaster">1. Beam Search: The Chess Grandmaster</h4>
<p>Beam search is like a chess grandmaster, always thinking several moves ahead to find the best overall strategy. It explores multiple possible sequences simultaneously, keeping track of the most promising paths.</p>
<p>At each step, beam search maintains a set number (let’s call it <code>k</code>) of the most likely partial sequences, known as hypotheses. This allows the model to consider sequences that may start with lower probability tokens but have higher overall probability, potentially leading to better quality outputs than simple greedy search.</p>
<p>The beauty of beam search is that it strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation. It’s not just picking the best immediate option, but considering how that choice might pan out in the long run. The final output is the sequence with the highest overall probability.</p>

<p>Importantly, traditional beam search with a width k reduces our astronomical search space from O(|V|^T) to O(k|V|T). That’s a significant improvement, though still a hefty computational load for real-time applications!</p>

<section id="multinomial-sampling-the-creative-writer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multinomial-sampling-the-creative-writer">2. Multinomial Sampling: The Creative Writer</h4>
<p>If beam search is our chess grandmaster, multinomial sampling is the free-spirited writer who throws caution to the wind and lets inspiration guide their pen.</p>
<p>This method introduces an element of controlled randomness into the text generation process. Unlike greedy search, which always picks the most probable token, multinomial sampling randomly selects the next token based on the probability distribution provided by the model. It’s like rolling a weighted die, where each face represents a possible next word, and the size of each face corresponds to its probability.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It allows for more diverse outputs. Every token with a non-zero probability has a chance of being selected, reducing the risk of bland, repetitive text. It’s how AI can surprise us with creative turns of phrase or unexpected (yet coherent) continuations of a prompt.</p>

<p>Diverse beam search divides the beams into groups and applies a diversity penalty to ensure that the outputs from different groups are distinct. Within each group, standard beam search is applied.

<p>Each of these decoding strategies offers different trade-offs between output quality, diversity, &amp; computational cost. The choice of strategy depends on the specific requirements of your task and the desired characteristics of the generated text. For example by playing with just a few parameters you can go from Greedy algorithm with extremely repetitive responses to versatile text giving human like responses.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-ais-deep-reflection-where-probability-flirts-with-search-and-models-judge-other-models-pickup-lines">In AI’s Deep Reflection: Where Probability Flirts with Search and Models Judge Other Models’ Pickup Lines</h2>
<p>For years, the AI community has been on a bulk-up routine that would make bodybuilders jealous - just feed the model more parameters and data. Inference scaling changes this up by giving AI models a gym membership and a personal trainer instead. It asks the question - instead of always making our models bigger, how do we make them think harder? Let’s dive into the three main approaches for that with a bit more technical detail this time.</p>
<section id="parallel-sampling-the-brute-force-charmer" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallel-sampling-the-brute-force-charmer">1. Parallel Sampling: The Brute Force Charmer</h3>
<p>Parallel sampling is a straightforward yet powerful technique in the world of inference scaling. At its core, it’s about generating multiple independent solutions and selecting the best one.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<p>When presented with an input, the AI model doesn’t generate just one answer. Instead, it produces N complete, independent answers. This process is akin to running the model N times in parallel, each time generating a full response to the input.</p>
<p>The key to this method’s effectiveness lies in its evaluation step. We employ a sophisticated evaluator, an Outcome Reward Model (ORM). This is an AI model, trained to assess the quality of generated answers based on various criteria. The ORM examines each of the N answers and assigns them a score. This scoring isn’t just based on correctness, but can include factors such as the quality of reasoning, clarity of explanation, and adherence to the task requirements.</p>
<p>Once all N answers have been scored, we can use a “best-of-N weighted” selection method to choose the final answer. This method is more nuanced than simply selecting the highest-scoring response. Instead, it considers all answers that arrived at the same conclusion and sums their scores. The conclusion with the highest total score is then selected as the final output.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formulation:</strong></p>
<p>For a given input x:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate outputs: y₁, y₂, …, yₙ</li>
<li>Score each output: s₁ = PRM(y₁), s₂ = PRM(y₂), …, sₙ = PRM(yₙ)</li>
<li>Final selection: y* = argmax(s₁, s₂, …, sₙ)</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, the selection process might be more complex, involving grouping similar outputs and summing their scores before selecting the highest-scoring group.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Simple and scalable. Improving results often involves simply increasing N, effectively leveraging additional computational resources to boost performance - a clear trade-off.</li>
<li>Works well for easier questions or tasks where generating a large number of attempts is likely to produce at least one high-quality answer.</li>
<li>Works especially when the space of possible good answers is relatively large and diverse.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Computationally inefficient for complex problems.</li>
<li>While it will eventually find a good solution if N is large enough, it may use significantly more resources than more targeted approaches.</li>
<li>The compute costs can become prohibitive if N is set too high, especially for resource-intensive models.</li>
<li>Each generation is independent, potentially repeating work or mistakes made in other attempts. It doesn’t learn from or build upon partial successes within a single attempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>All-in-all it is a simple but brute-force approach to inference scaling. Its straightforward nature makes it an attractive option, especially when dealing with tasks where the generation of multiple diverse attempts is likely to yield at least one high-quality result. However, its effectiveness needs to be balanced against its potential computational costs, especially for more complex tasks or when scaling to very large N.</p>
</section>
<section id="beam-search-the-chess-grandmaster-of-inference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beam-search-the-chess-grandmaster-of-inference">2. Beam Search: The Chess Grandmaster of Inference</h3>
<p>Unlike parallel sampling, which generates complete independent answers, beam search constructs solutions incrementally, making decisions at each step about which partial solutions are most promising to develop further.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initialization: The process begins by generating N initial predictions for the first step of the solution. These represent different starting points for the answer.</li>
<li>Scoring: A Process Reward Model (PRM) is used to score each of these N initial steps. The PRM evaluates the quality and potential of each partial solution. Note that this is also how it is different from an ORM above.</li>
<li>Pruning: Instead of keeping all N initial steps, beam search retains only the top N/M highest-scoring ones, where M is the beam width. This step focuses the search on the most promising partial solutions.</li>
<li>Expansion: For each of the retained partial solutions, the model generates M new proposals for the next step. This brings the total number of candidates back to N (N/M * M = N).</li>
<li>Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated until either a complete solution is reached or a maximum number of rounds is hit.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process allows beam search to maintain a diverse set of partially completed solutions, continually evaluating and refining them as it progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formulation:</strong></p>
<p>At each step t:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate candidates: C_t = {c₁, c₂, …, cₙ}</li>
<li>Score candidates: S_t = {PRM(c₁), PRM(c₂), …, PRM(cₙ)}</li>
<li>Keep top k: B_t = top_k(C_t, S_t, k=N/M)</li>
<li>Expand: C_{t+1} = ⋃_{b ∈ B_t} expand(b, M)</li>
</ol>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>C_t is the set of candidate partial solutions at step t</li>
<li>S_t is the set of scores for these candidates</li>
<li>B_t is the set of top-scoring candidates retained</li>
<li>expand(b, M) generates M new candidates from partial solution b</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Complex problem-solving where the solution is built incrementally.</li>
<li>Natural language generation tasks requiring coherent, long-form responses.</li>
<li>Multi-step planning or decision-making processes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is potential for pruning prematurely. By discarding lower-scoring partial solutions early, beam search might miss unconventional but ultimately superior solutions that don’t appear promising in their early stages.</li>
<li>While more efficient than exhaustive search, beam search can still be computationally intensive, especially with large beam widths or for problems requiring many steps.</li>
<li>Its performance can be highly dependent on the choice of N and M. Optimal values may vary significantly between different types of problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Beam search is particularly suited for problems where the solution quality depends on a series of interconnected decisions. Its ability to maintain and explore multiple promising solution paths makes it a go-to approach for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks in AI.</p>
</section>
<section id="revision-based-approach-the-perfectionists-dream" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revision-based-approach-the-perfectionists-dream">3. Revision-Based Approach: The Perfectionist’s Dream</h3>
<p>This approach is focuses on iterative improvement of an initial response. Unlike parallel sampling or beam search, which generate multiple independent answers or explore multiple paths simultaneously, this approach generates a single answer and then repeatedly refines it.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initial Generation: The model produces an initial answer to the given input.</li>
<li>Iterative Refinement: The model is then presented with its previous answer(s) along with the original input and asked to generate an improved version.</li>
<li>Repetition: This process of refinement is repeated for a predetermined number of iterations or until some convergence criterion is met.</li>
<li>Selection: Once all iterations are complete, the best version is selected using either an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) or a majority voting mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formulation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. Initial generation: y₀ = model(x)
2. for i = 1 to k:
      yᵢ = model(x, y₀, y₁, ..., yᵢ₋₁)
3. Final selection:
      y* = argmax(ORM(y₀), ORM(y₁), ..., ORM(yₖ))
      or
      y* = mode(y₀, y₁, ..., yₖ)</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>x is the input</li>
<li>yᵢ is the i-th revision</li>
<li>k is the total number of revisions</li>
<li>ORM is the Outcome Reward Model</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Revision Model: This is typically a fine-tuned version of the base language model, specifically trained to improve upon previous answers. The training process involves exposing the model to sequences of increasingly better answers to the same question.</li>
<li>Outcome Reward Model (ORM): This is a separate model trained to evaluate the quality of complete answers. It’s used to score each revision and select the best one.</li>
<li>Majority Voting: An alternative to ORM, this method selects the most common answer among all revisions. It’s particularly useful when multiple independent revision sequences are generated.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This approach allows for gradual refinement of the answer, potentially leading to high-quality results, especially for medium-difficulty questions.</li>
<li>It can be more computationally efficient than generating multiple complete answers, as in parallel sampling.</li>
<li>By considering previous attempts, the model can build upon its own insights and correct its mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This approach may get stuck in a local optimum, repeatedly making similar refinements without considering radically different approaches.</li>
<li>The quality of the final output can be heavily influenced by the quality of the initial answer.</li>
<li>Training a model to effectively revise its own work is a complex task, requiring sophisticated training data and techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>Revision-based approach represents a unique strategy in inference scaling, mimicking a facet of the human creative process of drafting and refining ideas. As I have mentioned elsewhere that I don’t think that’s the whole story as far as human creativity is concerned. However, the ability to iteratively improve upon its own output makes for a powerful tool in the AI toolkit, especially for tasks where quality can be enhanced through careful refinement and consideration of previous attempts.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-the-art-of-thinking-harder-not-just-bigger">Conclusion: The Art of Thinking Harder, Not Just Bigger</h2>
<p>This post has become way longer than originally intended so thanks for staying with it. For more details on performance metrics, and specific use-cases for each technique, I highly recommend checking out reference [3] below.</p>
<p>As I wrap up this journey, it’s clear to me that we are amid a paradigm shift (no not AGI). We’re moving from an era of “bigger is better” during training to a more nuanced approach that folds in clever inference algorithms as well in which ORM and PRM models are the unsung heroes. Their quality will set the upper bound on the quality of your inference scaling strategy.</p>
<p>And while these techniques will enable us to use copilots capable of more nuanced approaches to the problem this shift also means what earlier used to be a heavy training related capital expense borne by the model provider will turn more into an operational expense borne by the user.</p>

<section id="ai-afterhours-top-ai-papers-for-sep-06---sep-12-2024" class="level1">
<h1>🌙 AI Afterhours: Top AI Papers for Sep 06 - Sep 12, 2024</h1>
<p>Welcome to this week’s AI Afterhours! Let’s dive into the most exciting AI research from September 06 to September 12, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>“Guide-and-Rescale” introduces a self-guidance mechanism for effective tuning-free real image editing</strong>, tackling the challenge of balancing editing quality with preserving original image structure. By leveraging a modified diffusion sampling process and introducing layout-preserving energy functions, the method achieves impressive results. With a CLIP score of 0.243, LPIPS score of 0.228, and FID score of 39.07, it outperforms existing approaches. User studies show a strong preference for Guide-and-Rescale, with 85% favoring its editing quality and 70% its preservation quality. This breakthrough could revolutionize image editing, offering a fast, high-quality solution that maintains the essence of the original image.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01322v3">arXiv:2409.01322v3</a> 👍71</p>
<p><strong>The “Attention Heads of Large Language Models” survey provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs</strong>, specifically focusing on attention heads and their role in reasoning. By proposing a four-stage framework that draws parallels between human cognition and LLMs, the authors categorize existing research into Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation stages. The survey identifies 17, 14, 15, and 5 special attention heads in each stage respectively. This work is crucial for improving LLM interpretability and enhancing problem-solving capabilities, potentially leading to more advanced and transparent AI systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03752v2">arXiv:2409.03752v2</a> 👍54</p>
<p><strong>“Towards a Unified View of Preference Learning for Large Language Models” presents a comprehensive survey on aligning LLMs with human preferences</strong>. The authors propose a unified framework decomposing existing methods into model, data, feedback, and algorithm components. They categorize preference learning algorithms into four groups and highlight the importance of high-quality preference data and reliable feedback. Key findings include the use of 20K comparisons in the Webgpt dataset and 170K chats in the HH-RLHF dataset. This work is essential for developing more accurate and informative LLMs, addressing the critical challenge of AI alignment.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02795v3">arXiv:2409.02795v3</a> 👍48</p>
<p><strong>“PingPong” introduces a benchmark for evaluating role-playing capabilities of language models</strong> using a novel approach that leverages LMs to emulate users in dynamic, multi-turn conversations. The benchmark consists of player, interrogator, and judge models. Experiments show strong correlations between automated evaluations and human annotations, with Spearman correlations ranging from 0.3 to 0.64. Claude 3.5 Sonnet emerged as the best model in both English and Russian, while Llama 3.1 70B and Gemma 2 Ataraxy 9B were the top open models for English and Russian respectively. This benchmark provides a robust foundation for evaluating LMs in interactive scenarios, crucial for advancing conversational AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06820v1">arXiv:2409.06820v1</a> 👍46</p>
<p><strong>“FuzzCoder” proposes a novel approach to improve fuzz testing by leveraging large language models</strong> to predict mutation positions and strategies. By formulating fuzzing as a sequence-to-sequence paradigm and using fine-tuned LLMs, FuzzCoder significantly improves the effective proportion of mutation (EPM) and number of crashes (NC) compared to previous baselines. EPM values range from 2.10 to 19.51, while NC values span from 1 to 224. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize software vulnerability detection, leading to more secure software development and reduced risk of security breaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01944v1">arXiv:2409.01944v1</a> 👍34</p>
<p><strong>The “MEDIC” framework provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating LLMs in clinical applications</strong>, addressing the limitations of previous methods by assessing models across five critical dimensions: Medical reasoning, Ethical and bias concerns, Data and language understanding, In-context learning, and Clinical safety and risk assessment. The framework reveals that larger models excel in closed-ended tasks but not necessarily in open-ended clinical Q&amp;A. Notably, the Med42-Llama3.1-70b model achieved a high score of 97.9 in the Clinical Trials dataset for safety and ethical considerations. MEDIC offers a robust foundation for the safe and effective implementation of LLMs in healthcare, potentially transforming clinical practice.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07314v1">arXiv:2409.07314v1</a> 👍33</p>
<p><strong>“MMEvol” introduces a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework</strong> to enhance the diversity and complexity of training data for multimodal large language models. By employing three evolution methods - fine-grained perceptual, cognitive reasoning, and interactive evolution - MMEvol achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 vision-language benchmarks, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points compared to baseline models. Remarkably, it reaches top performance in nine tasks using significantly less data than current state-of-the-art models. This approach could significantly advance the development of more accurate and versatile multimodal AI systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05840v3">arXiv:2409.05840v3</a> 👍33</p>
<p><strong>“OneGen” presents an efficient one-pass unified generation and retrieval framework for LLMs</strong>, addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling retrieval tasks. By integrating retrieval and generation within the same context using a special [RQ] token, OneGen outperforms previous solutions in various tasks. It achieves a 1.5-point improvement on average in Single-hop QA datasets, a 3.3-point F1 increase in Multi-hop QA datasets, and a 3.2-point accuracy boost in out-of-domain entity linking datasets. This approach has the potential to enhance performance in numerous NLP applications, from information extraction to text summarization.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05152v2">arXiv:2409.05152v2</a> 👍21</p>
<p><strong>The “CDM” metric introduces a reliable approach for fair and accurate formula recognition evaluation</strong>, addressing the shortcomings of existing text-based character matching methods. By utilizing spatial character matching and incorporating visual feature extraction, CDM achieves a 96% consistency with human evaluation. It demonstrates robustness by scoring 1 in all samples of the Tiny-Doc-Math evaluation. Moreover, CDM enables efficient data selection, achieving comparable performance to using the entire dataset while only utilizing less than 20% of the data. This metric could significantly improve the accuracy and fairness of formula recognition evaluation across different models and datasets.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03643v1">arXiv:2409.03643v1</a> 👍16</p>
<p><strong>“mPLUG-DocOwl2” presents a high-resolution compressing technique for OCR-free multi-page document understanding</strong>, addressing the challenge of compressing high-resolution document images while retaining crucial visual information. The introduced High-resolution DocCompressor achieves 98% of the baseline model’s performance while reducing visual tokens from 2,560 to 324 and cutting first token latency by over 50%. This approach not only excels in multi-page document understanding but also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on single-page tasks with fewer visual tokens. The implications for multimodal large language models and OCR-free document understanding are significant, potentially transforming how we process and analyze complex documents across various fields.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03420v2">arXiv:2409.03420v2</a> 👍16</p>
<p>And that’s a wrap! See you next week!</p>

  <title>The Great Data Famine: Why the AI that Ate the Web Is Still Starving</title>
  <dc:creator>Shwetank Kumar</dc:creator>
  <link>https://shwetank-kumar.github.io/posts/data-scarcity/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you’re a software engineer or data scientist who’s been losing sleep over the Twitter-fueled hysteria that “English is the new coding language,” I’ve got news for you: put down the panic button and step away from the job boards. I am here to tell you that despite what the Twitterverse might have you believe, AI isn’t about to steal your job or create Skynet. And if you’re an exec or investor who thinks otherwise, I’ve got a Nigerian prince who’d love to chat.</p>
<p>After a weekend of wrestling with the latest and supposedly greatest codegen tools, I’ve come to a startling conclusion: our AI overlords aren’t quite ready to steal your job or usher in the age of Skynet. In fact, they’re struggling with tasks that would make a junior dev roll their eyes.</p>
<p>Let me paint you a picture: There I was, surrounded by caffeine and a stack of AI whitepapers, trying to coax these silicon savants into solving some basic coding problems. It became painfully clear that to tackle even the most fundamental challenges, we’re in desperate need of a quantum leap in LLM complexity.</p>
<p>What we really need is for these models to channel their inner project manager – breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks, crafting plans, and methodically conquering each incremental hurdle. But instead of this sophisticated problem-solving, our current crop of AI tools often resemble a caffeinated squirrel trying to solve a Rubik’s cube – lots of frantic activity, not a lot of progress.</p>
<section id="the-transformer-plateau-when-bigger-isnt-always-better" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-transformer-plateau-when-bigger-isnt-always-better">The Transformer Plateau: When Bigger Isn’t Always Better</h2>
<p>Remember when we thought the solution to every AI challenge was simply to make it bigger? It was like Silicon Valley’s version of “supersize me,” but instead of fries, we were supersizing parameters and datasets. Well, folks, that all-you-can-eat buffet of data and compute has reached its limit.</p>
<p>Since the “Attention is all you need” paper dropped and gave us the Transformer architecture, we’ve been playing a game of “who can build the biggest model?” It’s been like a digital arms race, with each new model flexing more parameters. And for a while, it worked! We fed these hungry, hungry hippos more data, cranked up the parameter count, and watched the benchmarks climb.</p>
<p>But now, we’ve hit a wall. A big, data-shaped wall that’s putting a damper on our “bigger is better” party. We’re now facing a trifecta of challenges that even the most optimistic VC can’t hand-wave away:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Scarcity:</strong> We’re scraping the bottom of the digital barrel, and it’s not pretty. Turns out, the internet isn’t infinite after all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> Our models are energy gluttons that could outshine Las Vegas. At this rate, we’ll need a small nuclear reactor for each training run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Complexity:</strong> We’re playing high-stakes Jenga with GPUs, hoping that one wobbly card doesn’t bring down the entire expensive house of silicon (aka cluster).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Unless we see some major breakthroughs in model architecture or how these Large Language Models (LLMs) learn, we’re stuck. Future AI products will be reheating the same capabilities we have today, just with fancier marketing. It’s like we’ve trained our AI to be a really eloquent parrot, but now we need it to write a novel.</p>
<p>Lets explore why our current AI models are perpetually data-starved, uncover the fundamental limitations of our learning approaches (backprop, SGD …), and maybe even find a path forward that doesn’t involve sacrificing our firstborns to the GPU gods. Welcome to the frontlines of the AI data crisis, in the land of diminishing returns – where the future is bright, but the training datasets are running on empty.</p>
</section>
<section id="beyond-chinchilla-llama-3.1-and-the-quest-for-more-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-chinchilla-llama-3.1-and-the-quest-for-more-data">Beyond Chinchilla: Llama 3.1 and the Quest for More Data</h2>
<p>Imagine an AI as a toddler with an endless appetite for knowledge. Now, picture that toddler devouring the entire internet and still asking for seconds. That’s our current predicament with Large Language Models (LLMs). These digital gluttons are slow learners with an insatiable hunger for data, and folks, we’re running out of internet to feed them. Who would’ve thought “we’ve run out of internet” would be a legitimate concern in 2024?</p>
<section id="exhibit-a-metas-llama-3.1---the-data-devourer" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exhibit-a-metas-llama-3.1---the-data-devourer">Exhibit A: Meta’s Llama 3.1 - The Data Devourer</h3>
<p>Let’s dive into a real-world example that’ll make your head spin: Meta’s latest 8B parameter Llama 3.1 model. This digital beast was fed a whopping 15 trillion tokens during training. For those keeping score at home, that’s essentially the entire publicly available internet. The Llama paper [1] claims it’s all public data, but they’re keeping the exact dataset under wraps. The closest we’ve got to peeking behind the curtain is the “Fine Web Dataset” [2] on Hugging Face, tipping the scales at a hefty 44TB.</p>
</section>
<section id="breaking-the-rules-when-more-is-more" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breaking-the-rules-when-more-is-more">Breaking the Rules: When More is… More?</h3>
<p>Now, if you’ve been following the AI literature like it’s the new Netflix, you might be thinking, “Wait a minute, isn’t that overkill?” And you’d be right - sort of. The Chinchilla paper [3], our previous guidebook for “compute optimal” training, would suggest that an 8B parameter model only needs about 160B tokens. Llama 3.1 ate roughly 100 times that amount!</p>
<p>But here’s the kicker: it worked. Meta’s decision to massively overindulge their model led to continued performance improvements. This reveals two mind-bending facts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Many existing models are actually undernourished by comparison.</li>
<li>High-quality data is the new oil in the AI gold rush.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even after this data feast, Llama 3.1 hadn’t reached what we’d classically call convergence. It was still improving, like a bottomless pit of potential [4]. This, combined with Microsoft’s Tiny Stories paper [5], is forcing us to rethink the data requirements for training these models.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bigger-they-are-the-hungrier-they-get" class="level3">

<p>And now consider the data requirements for 405B parameter version of Llama 3.1. It should ideally be trained on proportionally more data - we’re talking “several internets” worth. But guess what? It was trained on the same 15T tokens as its smaller sibling. If that dataset was barely enough for the 8B model, it’s like trying to feed a blue whale with a goldfish bowl for the 405B version.</p>

<p>Before you start stockpiling hard drives and building your own internet, there’s a glimmer of hope. For enterprises sitting on a goldmine of non-public data (that you’re legally allowed to use, of course), you’re in luck. This is your chance to fine-tune these models for specialized tasks and potentially push their performance beyond what’s publicly possible. And for the efficiency enthusiasts out there, there’s still plenty of room to explore knowledge distillation - teaching smaller models to mimic their bigger, data-guzzling cousins.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="synthetic-data-ais-infinite-mirror-of-confusion">Synthetic Data: AI’s Infinite Mirror of Confusion</h2>
<p>When faced with data scarcity, researchers and engineers came up with a brilliant idea: Why not leverage AI models to generate their own training data? This concept, far from being a desperate measure, is actually a legitimate and innovative approach to addressing the data hunger of large language models which offers many advantages like unparalleled scalability, solution for privacy preservation in training data, and customization for specialized tasks. However, it also comes with its own set of challenges.</p>
<section id="model-collapse-when-ai-goes-on-a-bland-diet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-collapse-when-ai-goes-on-a-bland-diet">Model Collapse: When AI Goes on a Bland Diet</h3>
<p>This self-cannibalization of data leads to what’s ominously known as ‘model collapse’. Don’t let the fancy term scare you - it’s simply what happens when your AI goes on a diet of nothing but its own increasingly bland word salad.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: the model (or its bigger cousin) generates tokens based on probability distributions so it favors tokens closer to the mean (the “average” outputs) providing fewer examples of tokens out in the wings of the distribution. After a few cycles of generating and training on synthetic data, you lose all the diverse content from the original dataset. Result? Your models over generations lose the brilliance and versatility that would come from diversity and start generating singular, monochromatic data which doesn’t capture the real world anymore.</p>
<p>Its like making a photocopy of a photocopy - each generation gets blurrier and weirder until you end up with something that looks like it came from a glitchy parallel universe where creativity went to die.</p>
</section>
<section id="bias-on-steroids" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bias-on-steroids">Bias on Steroids</h3>
<p>The opposite side of the same coin is that any small biases in the initial dataset get amplified out of propostion. So now the slight bias in your dataset is dialed to 11 on a scale of 10 and it thinks the entire world population consists of cat-loving, pizza-eating coders who never see the sun. Diversity? That’s just a myth, like inbox zero or bug-free code.</p>

<p>Validating synthetic data is like fact-checking a politician’s promises - a Sisyphusean task (i.e.&nbsp;can’t be done, easily anyway). It’s a guessing game where the grand prize is “maybe your AI won’t embarrass itself in public.” And good luck keeping it current - by the time you’ve generated your synthetic data, the real world has moved on, leaving your AI stuck in last season’s trends like a digital fashion faux pas.</p>

<p>But wait! Don’t despair just yet. One person’s data dilemma is another’s research opportunity. Here are some tantalizing questions for the brave AI researchers of tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we develop smarter sampling strategies to generate synthetic data from the neglected “wings” of the probability distribution?</li>
<li>What’s the perfect cocktail of real and synthetic data? Is there a golden ratio, or does it depend on the task?</li>
<li>How can we build Fort Knox-level security around our synthetic data generation process?</li>

<li>Synthetic data is a promising solution to data scarcity, offering scalability, privacy, and customization.</li>
<li>However, it comes with significant challenges: model collapse, bias amplification, quality control issues, and security risks.</li>
<li>The future of synthetic data lies in developing better generation strategies, finding optimal real-synthetic data ratios, and creating robust security frameworks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until we crack these problems, synthetic data is the AI world’s equivalent of combating climate change by painting everything green.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deep-networks-are-slow-learners">Deep Networks are Slow Learners</h2>
<p>The underlying problem that is a root cause of all our AI woes is that neural networks and other architectures using a combination of back propagation and stochastic gradient descent (let’s call these SGD &amp; Progeny Pvt. Ltd.&nbsp;to include other algorithms like Adam, Ada etc.) are slow learners - absorbing knowledge at the speed of continental drift. They’re the Pangaea of machine learning, slowly but inexorably shuffling bits of information around until, eons later, you might just have a functional model. Let’s look at how these work.</p>
<section id="the-sgd-conundrum-navigating-ikea-blindfolded" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sgd-conundrum-navigating-ikea-blindfolded">The SGD Conundrum: Navigating IKEA Blindfolded</h3>
<p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are the cornerstone of modern machine learning optimization techniques. However, their effectiveness is limited by their inherent randomness. It’s basically like trying to find your way out of an IKEA blindfolded by randomly stumbling around, making small adjustments to your trajectory based on very limited local information. You might eventually find the exit, but you’ll bump into a lot of BILLY bookcases along the way.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="escape-from-local-minima-the-comfortable-rut">Escape from Local Minima: The Comfortable Rut</h3>
<p>Neural networks often get trapped in suboptimal solutions, or “local minima,” during training. To overcome this, we need to expose our models to diverse, high-quality data repeatedly. However, the scale at which this needs to happen is staggering - often requiring millions of iterations. Of course, there are heuristics that can help you along in the process, but coming up with the right set of parameters for training and escaping each minima requires a lot of experimentation with hyperparameters.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hyperparameter-labyrinth-cracking-the-infinite-safe">The Hyperparameter Labyrinth: Cracking the Infinite Safe</h3>
<p>Hyperparameter tuning in machine learning is akin to trying to crack a safe with an infinite number of dials. Each parameter - learning rate, batch size, network architecture, etc. - can dramatically affect model performance, yet their interactions are often unpredictable and non-linear. It’s not uncommon for researchers to spend more time tuning hyperparameters than actually training models. This process is often more art than science, relying heavily on intuition, experience, and, frankly, a fair bit of luck.</p>
<p>Automated hyperparameter optimization techniques exist, and while helpful, often require significant computational resources and can still miss optimal configurations due to the vast search space. Moreover, hyperparameters that work well for one dataset or task might fail spectacularly on another, making it challenging to develop generalizable best practices.</p>
<p>The complexity of hyperparameter tuning also raises questions about the robustness and interpretability of our models. If slight tweaks to these parameters can lead to drastically different results, how can we trust the stability and reliability of our AI systems?</p>

<p>These models are turning into the Rain Man of useless information. Great if you need to count toothpicks, not so great for actual intelligence. As these models grow larger, they’re not getting smarter – they’re just getting better at regurgitating what they’ve seen before. It’s like that friend who can recite every line from “The Office” but can’t hold a conversation about anything else.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-silver-lining-future-directions">The Silver Lining: Future Directions</h3>
<p>Data scarcity, which is a direct result of these fundamental limitations, is pushing us towards an inflection point. We can’t just keep making models bigger and feeding them more data. We need to fundamentally rethink how these models learn and generalize. It’s like we’ve been trying to build a skyscraper by just piling up more and more bricks. Now we need to stop and think about architecture, efficiency, and maybe invest in an elevator or two.</p>
<p>Some promising directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that rely on second-order moments, though they require more memory to store gradients.</li>
<li>Combining these techniques with simplifying assumptions about the nature of the matrix [7], allowing us to store sparser versions.</li>
<li>Coupling these approaches with newer execution engines in GPUs for sparse matrices.</li>
<li>Exploring hardware-software co-design as a powerful research direction.</li>

<p>As we’ve explored in this article, the challenges facing AI development are numerous and complex. We’ve only scratched the surface of the data scarcity issue, and there are still two major hurdles we haven’t yet discussed: power consumption and system complexity.</p>
<p>The energy requirements for training and running these increasingly large AI models are staggering. As we push the boundaries of model size and complexity, we’re also pushing the limits of our computational infrastructure. The power consumption of these models isn’t just a technical issue—it’s an environmental and economic concern that the AI community will need to address.</p>
<p>System complexity is another critical challenge. As our AI systems grow more sophisticated, managing and optimizing them becomes increasingly difficult. We’re rapidly approaching a point where the complexity of these systems may outpace our ability to understand and control them effectively.</p>
<p>Down the road I intend to delve deeper into these issues, exploring the implications of AI’s growing energy appetite and the challenges posed by increasingly complex systems. In the meanwhile if there are things in this space that you would like to learn about - DMs are always open!</p>

  <title>The Surprisingly Lucrative Journey of Bootstrapping a Brand Recommender System: From Chaos to Cash</title>
  <dc:creator>Shwetank Kumar</dc:creator>
  <link>https://shwetank-kumar.github.io/posts/cold-start/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>While everyone seems captivated by AGI and busy building Just-Another-Chatbot (JAC<sup>TM</sup>), they’re overlooking the real problems that can be solved (and the money to be made) through practical ML Engineering. In this inaugural series of blog posts, I’ll dive deep into one such problem: bootstrapping and building a brand recommender system from the ground up. Drawing from my experience as an engineer, executive, and consultant across multiple consumer tech companies and marketplaces, I’ll guide you through the process of creating a recommendation engine that not only predicts customer preferences but also enhances their overall shopping experience.</p>
<p>We’ll explore the journey from raw data to a sophisticated system that can significantly boost your bottom line while offering your customers a personalized and delightful experience. So, let’s embark on this data-driven adventure and unlock the potential of personalized recommendations in e-commerce. By the end of this series, you’ll have the tools to transform your e-commerce platform into a cash machine that keeps both your customers and CFOs happy.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-e-commerce-is-a-jungle-and-your-customers-are-lost">The Problem: E-commerce Is a Jungle (And Your Customers Are Lost)</h2>
<p>Imagine you’ve just launched an e-commerce platform. It’s sleek, efficient, and boasts an impressive array of brands. Initially, you’re confident in its success. However, user feedback quickly reveals a common challenge in the e-commerce world:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m overwhelmed by the number of options.”</li>
<li>“The recommendations don’t seem relevant to my interests.”</li>
<li>“I can’t find products that match my specific needs.”</li>
</ul>
<p>These concerns are not uncommon. In the realm of online retail, the balance between variety and accessibility is crucial. Insufficient options can leave customers feeling limited, while an overabundance can lead to decision fatigue. This phenomenon, often referred to as the “paradox of choice,” can significantly impact user experience and, consequently, your conversion rates.</p>
<p>This, my friends, is why a good recommendation system is invaluable. It’s like having a wise, all-knowing friend who gently guides your customers to their next favorite purchase. And today, we’re going to build that friend from scratch.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-0-the-oh-crap-we-have-no-data-phase---totally-random-model">Step 0: The “Oh Crap, We Have No Data” Phase - Totally Random Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning (a very good place to start…). You’ve just launched your e-commerce platform. It looks great, it works smoothly, but there’s one big problem: you have no data. Your recommendation system is a blank slate. What do you do?</p>
<p>Take a deep breath and repeat after me: “Random is better than nothing.” Now, I know what you’re thinking. “But this is just throwing darts blindfolded! How is this helping anyone?” And you’re right, it’s not ideal. But here’s the secret: it’s not about being perfect; it’s about starting the flywheel.</p>
<p>Every time a user sees a random recommendation, you’re gathering data. Maybe they ignore it (data point!). Maybe they click on it (data point!). Maybe they buy it (cha-ching and data point!). Every product interaction (or lack thereof) is a breadcrumb that will lead you out of the data desert.</p>
<p>Let’s whip up a quick Python function to generate random recommendations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;

<span id="cb1-4">    <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;

font-style: inherit;">return</span> random.sample(all_brands, <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">min</span>(n, <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">len</span>(all_brands)))</span>
<span id="cb1-5"></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># Example usage</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">all_brands <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> df[<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'recommending_brand'</span>].unique().tolist()</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(get_random_recommendations(all_brands))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Pro tip: While you’re showing random recommendations, make sure you’re logging EVERYTHING. Every view, every click, every purchase. This data will be worth its weight in gold later on. Trust me, future you will thank present you for this foresight. And while you are at it do make sure that the data is high quality. Algorithms are fickle and state of the art on those changes every week – nay day! But poor quality data once logged sets the ceiling on what you can do with it.</p>

<p>Alright, so you’ve been running your random recommendation engine for a while. You’ve got some sales, you’ve got some brand data, but you still don’t have enough user interaction data to build a proper collaborative filtering system. Don’t worry, we’re going to make lemonade out of these lemons.</p>
<p>Enter: Feature-Based Clustering.</p>
<p>Now, gather ’round, because I’m about to share a secret: brands, like people, have personalities. And just like you wouldn’t set up your quiet, bookish friend with your party-animal cousin (trust me, I’ve made that mistake), you shouldn’t be recommending wildly dissimilar brands to your users.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple example using K-means clustering. Don’t let the fancy name scare you - it’s just a way of grouping similar things together.</p>

<p>Let me share a real-world example that illustrates the power of this approach. Back in the day I worked with a startup that had a range of products - everything from $5 friendship bracelets that screamed “summer camp chic” to $500 mid-century modern chairs that whispered “I have a trust fund.” Their recommendation system? About as sophisticated as a Magic 8-Ball with a hangover. It was the digital equivalent of that one clueless sales associate who tries to upsell you a tuxedo when you’re shopping for gym shorts.</p>
<p>The result? Their conversion rate was lower than my undergrad GPA (and trust me, that’s saying something). They addressed this by implementing a clustering system based on various product attributes. We’re talking price, category, style, color palette - if it could be quantified, they clustered it. And boom! Faster than you can say “artisanal hand-knitted cat sweater,” their click-through rates went through the roof! Their engineering blog was practically giddy with excitement (in that restrained, data-scientist kind of way) about the boost in overall sales.</p>
<p>Now a good data science algorithm needs to do at least two things (and definitely the second of these two): 1. It needs needs to improve a KPI - in this case conversions, although it can be anything. (e.g.&nbsp;if you are a Ferengi it will invariably be profits as laid out in the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition) 2. Regardless of whether it does 1. it needs to light the way to how you might improve the KPI in the future.</p>
<p>In this case, it wasn’t just the algorithm doing the work automatically, but the entire system we built around it. We maintained a degree of randomness in our recommendations to continue generating new data and learning from it. It’s like saying, “We know you’re interested in vintage decor, but have you considered this modern minimalist piece?” This approach not only serves immediate customer interests but also introduces them to new products they might enjoy. The lesson here? Even a relatively simple clustering approach can significantly improve your recommendation engine. It’s not about having the fanciest algorithm on the block; it’s about understanding your customers and not trying to sell snowshoes to someone shopping for flip-flops. So, whether you’re dealing with luxury items and budget options, or niche products and mainstream goods, remember: cluster wisely, but maintain some variety. Your conversion rates (and your customers) will thank you.</p>

<p>Now, let me tell you why this is a game-changer. Consider the case of Amazon, the e-commerce giant. In their early days, they primarily sold books. But as they expanded into other product categories, they faced a massive challenge: how to effectively cross-sell across these diverse categories? Their solution was to implement a sophisticated association model, much like the one we’ve just built (though admittedly, theirs was far more complex). This “item-to-item collaborative filtering” approach, as they called it, allowed them to say, “Customers who bought this item also bought…”</p>
<p>The impact was significant. According to a paper published by Amazon’s engineers in 2003 titled “Amazon.com Recommendations: Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering”, this recommendation system offered substantial advantages over traditional collaborative filtering techniques as it could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle a massive scale of data - tens of millions of customers and millions of catalog items.</li>
<li>Produce high-quality recommendations in real-time, scaling well to sudden spikes in traffic.</li>
<li>Recommend across diverse product categories, from books to electronics to clothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the paper doesn’t provide specific sales figures, it does mention that Amazon’s recommendation system significantly improved click-through and conversion rates compared to untargeted content such as top sellers.</p>

<p>Ever played “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”? Well, we’re about to do something similar with our brands, and it’s going to blow your recommendation socks off.</p>
<p>Direct associations are great, but they’re limited. What if we could create a web of associations, where brand A is connected to brand B, which is connected to brand C, creating an indirect link between A and C? It’s like being at a party where your network explodes as friends introduce you to their friends.</p>
<p>By considering second-order and third-order connections, we can uncover hidden relationships in our data, leading to nuanced and unexpected recommendations. Here’s how to do it in &lt; 10 lines of code:</p>

<p>Let’s break this down:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We start with our original adjacency matrix of direct brand connections.</li>
<li>We calculate higher-order connections up to a specified maximum (default 5, because six degrees of separation, right?).</li>
<li>Here’s the clever bit: we apply a weight factor. Each higher-order connection gets reduced weight because your friend’s friend’s friend’s opinion shouldn’t count as much as your direct friend’s.</li>
<li>We add all these weighted connections to our original matrix, creating a rich tapestry of brand relationships.</li>
<li>Finally, we normalize everything to keep our numbers manageable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result? A supercharged adjacency matrix capturing not just direct relationships, but a whole network of indirect connections.</p>
<p>Now, imagine a niche online bookstore specializing in obscure academic texts. Their inventory is so specific that direct associations are as rare as a first-edition Gutenberg Bible at a yard sale.</p>
<p>A customer buys “The Mating Habits of 12th Century Mongolian Horses” (yes, I’m having fun with these titles). In a traditional system, we’d be stuck. But with our transitive associations, we might recommend “The Economic Impact of Horse Trading in Medieval Asia”, even if no one had ever purchased these together. Our system could find a chain of associations linking them through other related books.</p>
<p>This approach enables academics to joyfully tumble down rabbit holes of related obscure topics, much to the store owner’s delight. It illustrates the power of transitive associations, especially for businesses with niche catalogs or sparse collaborative filtering matrices. We’re transforming a sparse matrix into a dense one, uncovering “hidden” connections that create a discovery engine to surprise and delight customers, potentially leading them down purchasing paths they never knew existed.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-fine-tuning-the-magic---hyperparameters-and-evaluation">Step 4: Fine-Tuning the Magic - Hyperparameters and Evaluation</h2>
<p>Alright, data enthusiasts, we’ve built our transitive association model, but now it’s time to give it that extra polish. Think of it as tuning a high-performance engine - we need to adjust the nitrous levels just right.</p>
<section id="hyperparameter-tuning-finding-the-sweet-spot" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hyperparameter-tuning-finding-the-sweet-spot">Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the Sweet Spot</h3>
<p>Remember our <code>expand_adjacency_matrix</code> function? It comes with two key hyperparameters:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>max_order</code>: How far down the rabbit hole of connections we’re willing to go</li>
<li><code>weight_factor</code>: Our trust factor for the friend of a friend of a friend</li>
</ol>
<p>These aren’t just arbitrary numbers we pulled out of a magician’s hat. They’re the secret sauce that can make or break our recommendations.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at <code>weight_factor</code>. Set it too high, and you might end up recommending winter parkas to someone shopping for swimwear. Set it too low, and you’re barely scratching the surface of potential connections.</p>
<p>So how do we find the Goldilocks zone? Enter: hyperparameter tuning. It’s like finding the perfect recipe, but instead of slurping soup, we’re crunching numbers.</p>

<p>Now, how do we know if our model is actually any good? We can’t just take it out for a test drive on the same roads we built it on. That’s where train-test splits come in handy.</p>
<p>Here’s our game plan:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split your data into training and test sets. Think of it as studying for an exam (training) and then taking the final (testing).</li>
<li>Build your adjacency matrix using only the training data.</li>
<li>Use your tuned model to make predictions on the test set.</li>
<li>Compare your transitive model against simpler approaches, like random recommendations or direct associations only.</li>

<p>Now, here’s what separates the good recommendation systems from the great ones: continuous improvement. Everything we’ve built so far is just the foundation. The real magic happens when you start iterating and refining.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fine-tune your clustering:</strong> As you gather more data, you might discover that certain features are more predictive than others. Don’t hesitate to adjust your approach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust association weights:</strong> Consider the context of purchases. Perhaps items bought together in the same transaction should carry more weight than those bought by the same customer on different days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimize hyperparameters:</strong> Regularly revisit your <code>max_order</code> and <code>weight_factor</code> settings. As your data grows and evolves, so too should your model’s parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incorporate user feedback:</strong> If customers consistently ignore certain recommendations, use that information to refine your model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A/B test rigorously:</strong> Test different versions of your model against each other. Let the data guide your decisions on which approaches work best for your specific use case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the goal isn’t perfection - it’s continuous improvement. Aim to build a system that consistently outperforms random chance, and then focus on making it a little better every day.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-real-world-impact-beyond-the-numbers">The Real-World Impact: Beyond the Numbers</h3>
<p>Now, I won’t give you specific numbers here because, let’s face it, your mileage may vary. But if you’ve done everything right, your transitive model should be outperforming the others like a sports car in a bicycle race. But here’s the real kicker: this isn’t just about better numbers on a spreadsheet. It’s about creating a recommendation system that feels almost eerily intuitive to your customers.</p>
<p>While we’ve covered significant ground in this post, we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible. In our next installment, we’ll explore how cutting-edge AI techniques can take our recommendation system to the next level. We’ll delve into methods that can create truly bespoke shopping experiences, predicting not just what a customer might want now, but what they’ll want next. From leveraging deep learning to harnessing the power of contextual bandits, we’ll explore how to create a recommendation engine that doesn’t just react to customer behavior, but anticipates it. It’s the difference between a skilled salesperson and a personal shopping psychic (with a Ph.D.&nbsp;in data science). In the end, that’s what separates a good recommendation system from a great one. It’s not just about predicting what customers want - it’s about inspiring them, delighting them, and yes, maybe even surprising them a little. So go forth, tune those hyperparameters, split that data, and may your conversion rates be ever in your favor!</p>
