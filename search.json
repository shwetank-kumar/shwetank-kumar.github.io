    "text": "I’m a physicist, engineering exec, investor. Here’s my story:\n\nBorn and raised in NCR, India. Delhi native, I live in SF.\nGot hooked on science early, did my B.Tech in EE from IIT, PhD in Applied Physics from Caltech. Learned business by working at startups (Orbital Insight, Turo, Achieve) and getting MBA at Wharton.\nInternet has been my playground and I specialize in Data and AI related games. Some systems I have enjoyed building over time:\n\nTuro: ML based risk framework\nOrbital Insight: Geospatial analytics platform at Orbital Insight\nIntel: universal stylus initiative specification\n\nI founded a bootstrapped company to help data teams optimize their Snowflake spend\n\n\n\n\nBuilt AI systems that crunch petabytes of data across image, text, and tabular formats\nScaled these systems to serve millions of customers simultaneously at Achieve and Turo\nCreated Orbital Insight’s flagship product for analyzing satellite imagery, growing it from $0 to $10M\nDoubled conversion rates and slashed acquisition costs using AI-driven personalization\nLed teams of 120+ brilliant minds in data science, engineering, and analytics\n\n\n\n\n\nPyTorch, Hugging Face, Langchain, Pydantic\nGCP, Snowflake\nAnything that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible with data\n\n\n\n\n\nAI and machine learning are reshaping every industry - get on board or get left behind\nThe best AI solutions come from a deep understanding of both technology and business needs\nSpeed matters - deploy fast, learn faster\nGreat teams are the secret sauce to any successful project\nEthical considerations should be baked into AI development from day one\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded and chair the due diligence committee for Invest in Data\nCommitted $100K+ of my own capital to shape the next generation of AI infrastructure\nAlways on the lookout for startups pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with data and AI\n\n[Space for startups invested in]\n\n\n\n\nWriting about AI, tech leadership, and data science on this blog\nSharing insights on LinkedIn\nTinkering with code on GitHub\nSpeaking at conferences about the future of AI and data\nMentoring the next generation of data scientists and AI engineers\n\nGot an exciting AI project or a game-changing startup idea? Let’s talk: shwetank.kumar@gmail.com\nRemember: The laws of physics are the only real limit. Everything else is just waiting to be disrupted by the right application of AI and data."
