## About Me

I'm an scientist, engineering exec, investor.

Some things about me:

<!-- - Grew up in Charlottesville, VA
- On the Internet since 1991, which is my actual "home town"
- Went to MIT because I loved the Richard Feynman [autobiographies](https://www.amazon.com/Richard-P-Feynman/e/B000AQ47U8/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1)
- Started [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian) [companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin)
- CEO of [GitHub](https://github.com) from 2018 through 2021
- Live in California
- Working on reading the [Herculaneum Papyri](https://scrollprize.org/)

## Beliefs

Some things I believe:

- As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences
  - Technology, which is really [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity), enables this
  - You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor
- Enthusiasm matters!
  - It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
  - It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
  - Energy is a necessary input for progress
- It's important to do things fast
  - You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
  - Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit
  - "Slow is fake"
  - A week is 2% of the year
  - Time is the denominator
- The efficient market hypothesis is a lie
  - At best it is a very lossy heuristic
  - The best things in life occur where EMH is wrong
  - In many cases it's more accurate to model the world as 500 people than 8 billion
  - "Most people are other people"
- We know less than we think
  - The replication crisis is not an aberration
  - Many of the things we believe are wrong
  - We are often not even asking the right questions
- The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful
  - Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgment
  - The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension
  - The downsides are worth it
- Smaller teams are better
  - Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun
  - No need to chop up work for political reasons
  - No room for mediocre people (can pay more, too!)
  - Large-scale engineering projects are more soluble in IQ than they appear
  - Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed
- Where do you get your dopamine?
  - The answer is predictive of your behavior
  - Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
  - It's ok to get yours from "making things happen"
- You can do more than you think
  - We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy
  - The laws of physics are the only limit

## Investing

- My current areas of interest are AI, infrastructure, open source, and (some) frontier tech
