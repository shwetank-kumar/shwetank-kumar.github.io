<!-- I'm a physicist, engineering exec, investor.

Some things about me:

- Born and brought up in New Delhi, India. I still consider myself a Delhi native
- Went to school at IIT Delhi for EE (B.Tech.), Caltech for Applied Physics (Ph.D.)
- Live in SF and like to spend my time here and in NCR India

Over the years I have done some interesting technical work. Reverse chronologically:

- Created an [ML based risk framework](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm) i.e. risk score, to improve cost of risk car sharing marketplace (Turo)
- Conceived and created [geospatial analytics platform](https://orbitalinsight.com/geospatial-technology) (Orbital Insight)
- Founded and was technical editor for the first [universal stylus initiative specification](https://universalstylus.org/) (Intel)
- Architected [forcepad](https://www.synaptics.com/products/touchpad-family/forcepad-product) and palm rejection (Synaptics)
- One of the 2 scientists to build out the quantum computing experiments group. [List](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=shwetank+kumar+quantum+computing&btnG=&oq=shwetank+kumar+quantum+comp) of publications (IBM) -->

## Shwetank Kumar

I'm a physicist, engineering exec, investor. Here's my story:

* Born and raised in NCR, India. Delhi native, I live in SF.
* Got hooked on science early, did my B.Tech in EE from IIT, PhD in Applied Physics from Caltech.
* Learned business by working at startups for 10+ years and getting MBA at Wharton.
* Internet has been my playground and I specialize in Data and AI games.
* I founded a bootstrapped company to help data teams optimize their Snowflake spend.

## Some things I've done

* Built AI systems that crunch petabytes of data across image, text, and tabular formats
* Scaled these systems to serve millions of customers simultaneously at Achieve and Turo
* Created Orbital Insight's flagship product for analyzing satellite imagery
* Doubled conversion rates and slashed acquisition costs using AI-driven personalization
* Led teams of 120+ brilliant minds in data science, engineering, and analytics

## Tech I love working with:
* PyTorch, Hugging Face, Langchain, Pydantic
* GCP, Snowflake
* Anything that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with data

## Some things I believe:
* AI and machine learning are reshaping every industry - get on board or get left behind
* The best AI solutions come from a deep understanding of both technology and business needs
* Speed matters - deploy fast, learn faster
* Great teams are the secret sauce to any successful project
* Ethical considerations should be baked into AI development from day one

## I'm an active investor in the AI and data space:
* Founded and chair the due diligence committee for Invest in Data
* Committed $100K+ of my own capital to shape the next generation of AI infrastructure
* Always on the lookout for startups pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data and AI

[Space for startups invested in]

## Where you can find me:
* Writing about AI, tech leadership, and data science on this blog
* Sharing insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetankkumar/)
* Tinkering with code on [GitHub](https://github.com/shwetank-kumar)
